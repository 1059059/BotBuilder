## Slack

## Twitter
* When a user mentions a bot on Twitter for the first time, there is up to a 7 minute delay between the time of the mention and when the bot "sees" the request
* A bot will only respond to mentions when they are mentioned at the beginning of the message, as in:

		"@EchoBot Hello!", but not "Hello @EchoBot!"
* Twitter DM's will not show photos in line; but rather will render a link to the document

## SMS

* Bots chatting via SMS always reply directly to the sender of the message rather than replying to the group.  In turn, a bot will always see two users in the TotalParticipants field when using SMS
* If you're having troubles with with SMS, be sure to check the Twilio service logs; they provide a wealth of information. Logs are kept associated with your phone number in your account: [](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/logs?toNumber=+1%20XXX-XXX-XXXX)
* Rate limit: 1 msg/s (long number) vs. 30 msg/s (short code) <a href="https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/how-many-calls-and-sms-messages-per-second-can-my-twilio-account-make" target="_blank">Twilio docs</a>
* Carrierâ€™s spam filtering/blocking logic <a href="https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/sms/how-can-i-prevent-my-messages-from-being-filtered-as-spam" target="_blank">Twilio docs</a>

## GroupMe

* Users: To remove bots from your group visit:  [](https://web.groupme.com/profile/access_tokens)
* If list of groups is from different group during user setup, open an incognito window or clear your "oauth.groupme.com" cookie
	
## Telegram

* By default, bots on Telegram only receive messages if they are mentioned (due to Telegram privacy setting).  To have them see all messages use the @BotFather account to configure the bot's /setprivacy setting
* In order to register a bot on Telegram, the developer account registering the bot has to FIRST have isntalled the Telegram client on some machine.  It won't work if the account is an SMS only account.
