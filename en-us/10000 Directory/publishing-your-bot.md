In order to publish your bot to the available directories, you need to do two things: 

1. Connect your bot to at least one channel which appears in the Bot Directory (note - the Direct Line channel is a special-purpose channel which does not appear in the Directory as of now) , and
2. Select "Publish" in the bot dashboard.

Below are screen captures which illustrate the flow from tapping "Publish" to visibility in the directories. Available directories at the moment include the Microsoft Bot Directory and Skype apps (note - as of April 29th, 2016 the Bot Directory is open for submission; we do not yet have a date set for the Bot Directory to be open to the general public; stay tuned for a future announcement on that front).
