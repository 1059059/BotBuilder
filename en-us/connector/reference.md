The Bot Connector service is a component of the Bot Framework that lets your bot easily connect with users on channels, such as SMS, Skype, Slack, and Facebook, that you configure when you registered your bot. The Connector service sits between your bot and the channels, and synchronizes the messages between them.

To send and receive messages from the connector, you can use the Bot Connector REST API. The API is a collection of endpoints and JSON objects that you use to start conversations, send messages, add attachments, and get members of the conversation.

See the following sections for [endpoints](#endpoints), [headers](#headers), and [classes](#classes) that you use to write your bot. 


<a id="endpoints" />

### Endpoints

The following is the base URI that you use in all Connector REST requests.

`https://api.botframework.com`

The following are the URI templates that you use to access Connector resources.

|**Template**|**Verb**|**Description**|**Resource**

### Headers

In addition to the standard HTTP request and response headers, the connector API uses the following headers.

|X-Correlating-OperationId|Response header.<br/><br/>Contains the ID of the log entry that provides details of the request. You should always capture this ID if an error occurs.
