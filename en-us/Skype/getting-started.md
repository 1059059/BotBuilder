You've come to the right place to build and publish a Skype bot - with cards, groups and calling - using the Microsoft Bot Framework.

## Creating a Skype bot

All bots created using the Microsoft Bot Framework are automatically configured and ready to work in Skype.

See the [Microsoft Bot Framework Overview](/en-us/) to learn how to:

1. Build a bot using the [C# SDK](/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/), [Node.js SDK](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/modules/_botbuilder_d_.html) or [Skype REST API](/en-us/skype/chat)
2. Test it using the [Bot Framework Emulator](/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator/)
3. Deploy the bot to a cloud service, such as [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/)
4. [Register](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new) the bot with the Microsoft Bot Framework, which will automatically add Skype as a channel. **When you first register a bot it will be in Preview**, which means it can be added by up to 100 users using an [add button or URL](#add-button-or-URL). To remove the limit you can easily publish it in Skype using the Microsoft Bot Framework.
5. [Add the bot](#adding-a-bot) to the latest version of Skype for mobile or desktop platforms - and test

## Publishing

Publish your bot from the [Bot Dashboard](https://dev.botframework.com/bots) to remove user limits and request for it to be shown in the Skype app bot directory and Microsoft bot directory. You can choose to automatically show in directories, or enable it later from the Bot Dashboard. Skype will review your bot to remove the limit, and may select it for the Skype app bot directory and/or Microsoft bot directory.

Please make sure to read the [Best Practices](http://docs.botframework.com/directory/best-practices/),  [Review Guidelines](http://docs.botframework.com/directory/review-guidelines/),  [Terms of use](https://aka.ms/bf-terms) and [Code of Conduct](http://aka.ms/bf-conduct) before publishing your bot.

The [Terms of Use](https://aka.ms/bf-terms) contains Sample Terms you can use to help create your own Terms of Service and the [Code of Conduct](http://aka.ms/bf-conduct) contains links to third party Privacy Statement resources.

## Finding and adding bots in Skype

Users can find and add your Skype bot in several ways.

### Add button or URL
{:.no_toc}

You can create an add button [here](https://www.skype.com/en/developer/create-addbot-button/) or copy and paste the add URL from the bot dashboard which will look like this https://join.skype.com/bot/YourAppID e.g.[https://join.skype.com/bot/29415286-5a43-4a00-9dc5-bcbc2ce1f59e](https://join.skype.com/bot/29415286-5a43-4a00-9dc5-bcbc2ce1f59e).

![Add button](/en-us/images/skype/skype-add-to-button.png)

When a user taps or clicks the add button or add URL they will be prompted to sign into Skype if necessary and redirected to a page with information about your bot and its capabilities. After they tap to add your bot they will be redirected straight into a chat with the bot in a [Skype app](#) or the [Skype web app](http://web.skype.com).

![Add to contacts](/en-us/images/skype/skype-add-to-contacts.png)

### Skype bot directory
{:.no_toc}

In specific markets (Currently USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand) Skype users with the most recent app version will see an Add bots button which opens the Skype bot directory.

![Search for a bot](/en-us/images/skype/skype-bot-search.png)

![Find a bot](/en-us/images/skype/skype-bot-find.png)

![View bot profile](/en-us/images/skype/skype-bot-profile.png)

![Welcome page](/en-us/images/skype/skype-bot-welcome.png)

### Microsoft bot directory
{:.no_toc}

Bots that are approved for Skype may also appear in the [Microsoft bot directory](https://bots.botframework.com/)

### How a bot appears in Skype
{:.no_toc}

Once a bot has been added it will appear in your conversation history in the same way as a chat with another user, but with a hexagonal avatar. 

![Bot in Skype](/en-us/images/skype/skype-bot-avatar.png)

<div class="docs-text-note">Bots in Skype always appear online and do not have a mood message</div>

## Messages

Your bot can send rich text, emoticons, pictures and cards to a user or group. Users can send rich text and pictures to your bot. You can specify the type of content your bot can handle in the Skype settings page for your bot. 

|  |From user to bot	|From bot to user                                          
|-------------|:------------------:|:---------------:|---------------
|Rich text| ✔ | ✔ | Including emoticons :)
|Pictures | ✔ | ✔ | PNG, JPEG or GIF up to 20Mb
|Video | Coming soon | ✔ | MP4, AAC+h264 up to 15Mb (approx. 1 minute), plus JPEG thumbnail
|Cards | ✔ | ✔ |

### Basic format
{:.no_toc}

Each Skype user is assigned a unique ID for your bot, which is sent along with the Display Name with every message.

{% highlight json %}

{
  "text": "Hello (wave)",
  "id": "1466182688092",
  "type": "message/text",
  "timestamp": "2016-06-17T16:58:08.74Z",

    "name": "Trivia Master"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The from field contains the unique user ID (prefixed by 29) and user Display Name. The to field contains the App ID (prefixed by 28: which indicates a bot in Skype) and bot Display Name. In Skype your bot is addressed using the Bot Framework App ID (a GUID).

## Groups 

A bot can be enabled for groups in the Skype settings for the bot. It can be added to a group chat in the same way as adding a participant to a chat. In a group the bot will only receive messages directly addressed to it e.g. "@YourBot This is the message". It will not receive other messages sent by group participants or notifications of users joining or leaving the group.

![At mention](/en-us/images/skype/skype-bot-at-mention.png)

To enable a bot to be added to a group chat you need to add this capability in Settings. Go to your Bot Dashboard and Edit the Skype channel. 

![Add groups](/en-us/images/skype/skype-settingsgroups.png)

## Calling (Preview)

You can build Skype bots that can receive and handle voice calls using the [.NET SDK](http://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/calling.html), [Node.js SDK](#) or [Skype  API](http://docs.botframework.com/en-us/skype/calling/#navtitle).

Each time a Skype user places a call to your bot, the Skype bot platform will notify the bot using the calling webhook you specify in settings. In response the bot can provide a set of basic actions called a workflow.

Supported actions:

* Answer
* Play prompt
* Record audio
* Speech to text
* DTMF tones
* Hang up

The Skype bot platform will execute the actions on the bot's behalf according to the workflow.

If the workflow is successful, Skype will post a result of the last action to your calling webhook. For example, if the last action was to record an audio message the result will be audio content. 

During a voice call your bot can decide after each result on how to continue interaction with the Skype user. 

<div class="docs-text-note"><b>Note:</b> Skype bots with calling enabled are for preview only cannot currently be published. To publish a bot in Skype you will need to disable calling in the Skype settings for your bot and then set published to enabled in the bot dashboard. </div>

<div class="docs-text-note"><b>Note:</b> Bots can handle 1:1 calls, but not group calls</div>

## Bing Entity and Intent Detection (Preview)

You can choose to have entities and intents automatically detected and sent along with the message text to your bot. A single intent and several entities may be returned.
