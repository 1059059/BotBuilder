Bot Builder for Node.js is targeted at Node.js developers creating new bots from scratch. By building your bot using the Bot Builder framework you can easily adapt it to run on nearly any communication platform. This gives your bot the flexibility to be wherever your users are.

* [Bot Builder for Node.js Reference](/en-us/sdkreference/nodejs/modules/_botbuilder_d_.html)
* [Bot Builder on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder)

## Install
Get the latest version of Bot Builder using npm.

    npm install --save botbuilder
    npm install --save botbuilder-calling

### v3.2.1

__Breaking Changes__

These changes will impact a small number of bots.

* Updated IRecognizerActionResult.matched and IIntentRecognizerResult.matched to return all the matched results as an array versus just the text that matched. These changes shouldn't effect many people as its likely you were already re-evaluating the matched expression if you needed the capture data.
* Added a new RecognizeMode for IntentDialogs which solves in issue where launching an IntentDialog as a sub dialog would cause it to immediately process the last utterance. This should only be a breaking change if you are using multiple IntentDialogs to scope down from a general model to a more specialized model.  In that case you'll want to create your specialized IntentDialogs with a `recognizeMode: builder.RecognizeMode.onBegin`.

__Other Changes__

* Added support for ordinal words to EntityRecognizer.parseNumber().
* Added support for Facebook Quick Replies.
* Added new Session.sendTyping() function.   
* Added optional callback param to sendBatch().
* Added IntentDialog.matchesAny() method that takes an array of intents to match.
* Fixed an issue for middleware that was causing session.beginDialog() calls to always run in the current dialogs library content which was often a system prompt. Now middleware assumes the default library context. 
* Added support for gzip your bot data.
* Fixed an issue where storing too much bot data would get your bot into a stuck state.
* Updated LKG build and package.json version.

__Breaking Changes__

None of these changes are likely to effect anyone but they could so here are the ones that may break things:

* Updated arguments passed to BotConnectorBot.listen().
* Renamed ISessionArgs to ISessionOptions and also renamed Session.args to Session.options.
* Made Session.createMessage() private. It doesn't need to be public now that we have new Message builder class.

__Other Changes__

* Significant improvements to the Reference Docs.

* Added support to SlackBot for sending an isTyping indicator. This goes along with the message slow down.
* Added a new Message builder class to simplify returning messages with attachments. See the send-attachment.js test in TestBot for an example of using it.
* Added a new DialogAction.validatedPrompt() method to simplify creating custom prompts with validation logic. See basics-validatedPrompt example for a sample of how to use it.
* SlackBot didn't support returning image attachments so I added that and fixed a couple of other issues with the SlackBot. 
* Updated the LKG build, unit tests, and package.json version.

* Updated LKG build and package.json version.

### v0.6.4
* LUIS changed their scheme for the prebuilt datetime entity and are no longer returning a resolution_type which caused issues for EntityRecognizer.resolveTime(). I know use either resolution_type or entity.type.
* Updated LKG build and package.json version.

### v0.6.3
