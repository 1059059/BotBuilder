Microsoft Bot Framework is a comprehensive offering to build and deploy high quality bots for your users to enjoy in their favorite conversation experiences. Developers writing bots all face the same problems: bots require basic I/O; they must have language and dialog skills; they must be performant, responsive and scalable; and they must connect to users – ideally in any conversation experience and language the user chooses. Bot Framework provides just what you need to build, connect, manage and publish intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking – from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Office 365 mail and other popular services.

The Bot Framework consists of a number of components including the Bot Builder SDK, Developer Portal and the Bot Directory.

### Bot Builder SDK

The Bot Framework Developer Portal lets you connect your bot(s) seamlessly text/sms to Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Office 365 mail and other popular services. Simply register your bot, configure desired channels and publish in the Bot Directory. All bots registered with Bot Framework are auto-configured to work with Skype and the Web.

The Bot Directory is a public directory of all reviewed bots registered through the Developer Portal. Users will be able to discover, try, and add bots to their favorite conversation experiences from the Bot Directory. Initially the Bot Directory will feature bots demonstrated at [Microsoft Build 2016](http://build.microsoft.com/).
