The Microsoft Bot Framework provides everything you need to build and connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services.

Bots (or conversation agents) are rapidly becoming an integral part of one’s digital experience – they are as vital a way for users to interact with a service or application as is a web site or a mobile experience. Developers writing bots all face the same problems: bots require basic I/O; they must have language and dialog skills; and they must connect to users – preferably in any conversation experience and language the user chooses. The Bot Framework provides tools to easily solve these problems and more for developers e.g., automatic translation to more than 30 languages, user and conversation state management, debugging tools, an embeddable web chat control and a way for users to discover, try, and add bots to the conversation experiences they love.

The Bot Framework has a number of components including the Bot Connector, Bot Builder SDK, and the Bot Directory.

## Bot Connector

The Bot Connector lets you connect your bot(s) seamlessly to text/sms, Office 365 mail, Skype, Slack, and other services. Simply register your bot, configure desired channels and publish in the Bot Directory.

The Bot Builder SDK is [an open source SDK hosted on GitHub](https://github/Microsoft/BotBuilder) that provides everything you need to build great dialogs within your Node.js- or C#-based bot.

## Bot Directory (coming soon)

The Bot Directory is a public directory of all approved bots registered through the Bot Connector. Users will be able to discover, try, and add bots to their favorite conversation experiences from the Bot Directory. Initially the Bot Directory will feature bots demonstrated at [Microsoft Build 2016](http://build.microsoft.com/).
