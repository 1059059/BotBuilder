The Microsoft Bot Framework provides everything you need to build and connect your bots to your users wherever they converse – from sms to Office365 mail to Slack and more… It’s your bot, wherever your users are talking. 

If you already have a bot and would like to extend its reach to more users on more conversation channels use the Bot Connector SDK. Simply register your bot, connect it to any or all of the nine available channels and (optionally) list it in the Bot Directory, a publicly accessible directory of all bots registered through the Bot Connector service. 

If you are just getting started with bot development, the Bot Builder SDK provides everything you need to build a great bot – from simple command dialogs to simple to use yet sophisticated “FormFlow” dialogs – the SDK provides libraries, comments and samples to get you up and running. When your bot is ready to meet the world, connect it via Bot Connector to the channels of your choice.

The Bot Directory is a publicly accessible directory of all bots registered through Bot Connector. Every bot can have a contact card in the directory which provides a description of the bot as well as the channels on which the bot is available. You and your users can even have a conversation with your bot while in the directory using “Direct Line” – a web chat control that makes it easy to take your bot for a test drive.
