Experience Principles

### Provide as much value to the user as you can in the conversation channel

<u1>
<u1> Reduce bouncing the user out from the messaging canvas to destination pages & apps during task completion
</u1>

### Participate in a productive conversation in a natural way with minimal complexity

<u1>
<u1> Brief but meaningful responses with a bias towards text-based answers that are glanceable, card, image or button answers that are crisp, clear, actionable. Human-like typing speed. 
</u1>

### Utilize the interaction patterns of the messaging canvas and the mobile OS

<u1>
<u1> Use themes, UI, and an IA familiar to users. Users should know what to expect when they engage with bot’s responses (e.g., tap on a photo.)
</u1>

### Have a clear POV on what scenarios the bot will handle brilliantly

<u1>
<u1> Know the user problem, the value prop of your bot, and how your bot is better than other currently available solutions.
</u1>

Best Practices


### Craft an engaging welcome message

  <ul>
  <li>Always introduce your Bot to members of the chat.  </li>
  <li>Let users know how they can interact with your Bot (e.g., list command interfaces your Bot supports). </li>
  <li>Engage them by requesting a response and wait for the user to respond before continuing the conversation. </li>
  </ul>

### Emotion, variety and personality are vital

  <ul>
  <li>Unless you want to deliberately project a robotic persona, make your Bot colorful and rich in expression (e.g., using different font-styles, emoticons etc. in your Botâ€™s script). Try to keep variety in the conversation responses when the same topic or question comes up multiple times in a conversation. Over time, based on the tone and character of your Bot, the user should build a character for your Bot in their mind. </li>
  </ul>

### Be judicious with data and message frequency

  <ul>
  <li>Don't send out too many messages in sequence when they can be grouped into a single message. </li>
  <li>Be cognizant of the userâ€™s network-speed and bandwidth charges  when sending images and/or videos. </li>
  <li>If you want to do something out of the ordinary (e.g. send a 100 messages in the next minute, send a large file etc.), then take consent from the user before doing it. </li>
  <li>Don't send out messages that might appear as spam (e.g. wishing a user â€œGood nightâ€ at 10 pm every night). </li>
  </ul>

### Give feedback

  <ul>
  <li>It's always good to give a sense of awareness to the user. Let the user know if the Bot understood or didn't understand the userâ€™s response. Paraphrase and/or confirm if the Bot is uncertain about the userâ€™s intent and before performing more involved (or irrevocable) actions like deleting something permanently.  <br>
  *If the Bot needs to take time in performing time-intensive actions, don't leave the user hanging.  </li>
  </ul>

### Keep the user in control

  <ul>
  <li>The user must not feel constrained or forced by the Botâ€™s script. Let the user tailor the Bot to suit their needs, for example, if the Bot sends updates on five categories of something but the user is only interested in two, let the user turn off updates for the other three. </li>
  <li>Let the user select from options in your script wherever appropriate.  </li>
  </ul>

### Be nice and do the right things including but not limited to: 

  <ul>
  <li>Being respectful and considerate of everyone; </li>
  <li>Respecting user privacy; </li>
  <li>Not being be rude in conversations; </li>
  <li>Striving for quality; </li>
  <li>Operating with integrity. </li>
  </ul>
