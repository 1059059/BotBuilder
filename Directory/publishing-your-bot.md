In order to publish your bot to the Bot Directory, you need to do two things: 

1. Connect your bot to at least one channel which appears in the Bot Directory (note - the Direct Line channel is a special-purpose channel which does not appear in the Directory as of now) , and
2. Select "Publish to directory" in the bot dashboard, bot header.

Below are screen captures which illustrate the flow from tapping "Publish" to visibility in the Bot Directory (note - as of April 29th, 2016 the Bot Directory is open for submission; we do not yet have a date set for the Bot Directory to be open to the general public; stay tuned for a future announcement on that front).
