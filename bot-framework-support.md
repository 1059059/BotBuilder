1. For general site/BotFramework feedback: [botframework@microsoft.com](mailto:botframework@microsoft.com) alias
2. For support using a bot â€“ contact the bot's developer through their publisher e-mail (maybe call that Bot Support Email instead of Publisher Email?)
3. For support building bots and connecting to the Bot Framework, use StackOverflow, with the hashtag #botframework
4. And for issues with the Bot Framework SDK's, use the issues tab on our Git repo: [https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/)
