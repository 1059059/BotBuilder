One of the basic requirements in writing your own Bot service is to seed it with questions and answers.

In many cases, the questions and answers already exist in content like FAQ URLs/documents, etc. The QnA maker attempts to automate the extraction of questions and answers from existing content and also apply simple techniques of query similarity to build a knowledge base.

This knowledge base can then be exposed as an endpoint, which can be used in your Bot service to get a response for the user query.
